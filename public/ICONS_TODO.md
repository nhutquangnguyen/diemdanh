# PWA Icons TODO

The app needs PWA icons for installation:

## Required Icons:
- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create:
1. Design a square icon with your logo/brand
2. Export as PNG at 192x192 and 512x512
3. Place in this `/public` folder
4. Or use a tool like: https://favicon.io/

## Temporary Solution:
The app will work without icons, but the install prompt won't show a proper icon.

## For Now:
You can continue testing. Add proper icons before production deployment.
